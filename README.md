Calendera is an AI-powered communication hub that consolidates messages from Gmail, Slack, Discord, iMessage, WhatsApp, and more into one intelligent dashboard. Using Claude AI, it automatically categorizes messages, extracts calendar events and tasks, and helps you manage your digital life‚Äîall in one place.

## Problem

Managing multiple communication platforms is overwhelming:

- **Gmail, Slack, Discord, iMessage, WhatsApp, Telegram** ‚Äî all separate apps
- Important messages like "let's meet tomorrow at 3pm" get buried in noise
- Manually extracting events and tasks from messages is tedious
- No central place to see what actually matters

Key challenges:

- Context switching between 10+ apps daily
- Missing important events hidden in casual messages
- Drowning in spam, marketing, and low-priority notifications
- No way to quickly ask "what's on my schedule today?"

## üí° Solution

Calendera uses **Claude AI** to read your messages and automatically organize your digital life.

Connect your accounts, and Calendera:
- **Categorizes every message** into Events, Todos, Social, Recruitment, Spam, etc.
- **Extracts calendar events** from natural language ("coffee tomorrow at 3?" ‚Üí calendar entry)
- **Finds action items** and deadlines ("send that report by Friday" ‚Üí todo list)
- **Answers questions** via AI chatbot ("What's on my schedule?", "Any urgent tasks?")

All platforms in one dashboard. All information auto-organized. All accessible through natural language.
